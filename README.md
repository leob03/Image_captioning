# Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention
Implementation of neural network model that can generate natural language captions for images. Three different architectures are proposed and compared: first one uses vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs), second one long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), and third one attention-based LSTMs.
